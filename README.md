This project is still in development. Some parts are unfinished and yet to be optimized.
The program is made for displays with the resolution 1920x1080 pixels, it will not work as expected with other resolutions.

This started as an assignment for a coding class but is something that I have worked on during my free time too just to learn and push myself.
I am well aware that Raylib isn't the most optimal library to use for developing a drawing program, but I wanted to challenge myself!
